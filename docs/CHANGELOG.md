# Changelog

All notable changes to the Agentic Threat Hunting Framework (ATHF) will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.14.0] - Unreleased

### Added
- **Hypothesis persistence on research docs** — `athf_agent_run_hypothesis` MCP tool now appends generated hypotheses directly onto the source `R-XXXX` research document under a `## Generated Hypothesis` section, with structured metadata in the YAML frontmatter (`generated_hypothesis: { hypothesis, mitre_techniques, data_sources, generated_at }`). When a `research_id` is supplied, the MCP response collapses to a preview-only payload (`research_id`, `file_path`, `mitre_techniques`, `data_sources`, ~200-char preview), reducing inline payload size and helping prevent autocompact thrash on long hunt orchestration conversations.
- `ResearchManager.append_hypothesis()` — idempotent helper that creates or replaces the `## Generated Hypothesis` section and updates frontmatter.

### Changed
- `athf_agent_run_hypothesis` MCP response now includes a `persisted` boolean. Without `research_id`, behavior is unchanged (full inline payload, `persisted=false`). With a valid `research_id`, the hypothesis is written to disk and only a preview is returned (`persisted=true`).

### Notes
- Hunt orchestration conversations are sensitive to large LLM-emitted artifacts. Smaller models with tighter effective working windows (e.g. Haiku-class) can autocompact-thrash when an inline hypothesis is followed by tool calls that re-include it. This release moves the hypothesis to disk so subsequent turns reference it by ID. For hunt orchestration over MCP, prefer Sonnet-class models when available; the persistence pattern reduces the dependency.

## [0.11.0] - Unreleased

### Added
- **MCP Server** — Expose ATHF operations as MCP tools for AI assistants (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor)
  - 14 tools: hunt list/search/get/stats/coverage/validate/new, similar, context, research list/view/search/stats, investigate list/search, agent hypothesis/researcher
  - `athf mcp serve` CLI command and `athf-mcp` standalone entry point
  - Auto-detect workspace from cwd or `ATHF_WORKSPACE` env var
  - Install with: `pip install 'athf[mcp]'`
- **ATT&CK STIX Integration** — Replace hardcoded ATT&CK dictionary with live STIX data via `mitreattack-python`
  - Provider abstraction: `StixProvider` (835+ techniques with full metadata) and `FallbackProvider` (hardcoded v14)
  - Auto-selects STIX when `mitreattack-python` is installed and data is cached; graceful fallback otherwise
  - New CLI commands: `athf attack update`, `athf attack status`, `athf attack lookup`, `athf attack techniques`
  - Technique metadata: platforms, data sources, tactics, sub-techniques, descriptions, URLs
  - STIX cache: configurable via `ATHF_STIX_CACHE` env var, workspace-local, or `~/.athf/stix-data/`
  - Fully backward compatible — existing `ATTACK_TACTICS`, `TOTAL_TECHNIQUES`, and all functions work identically
  - Install with: `pip install 'athf[attack]'`

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Model-agnostic LLM provider abstraction** — Replace hardcoded AWS Bedrock with support for Claude, GPT, Gemini, Ollama, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  - `athf/core/llm_provider.py` with 4 providers (LiteLLM, Bedrock, Ollama, OpenAI-compatible)
  - Auto-detection from environment variables with layered config resolution
  - Cost tracker with fuzzy model name matching (`athf/core/cost_tracker.py`)
  - Validation-retry loop for agent self-correction on malformed LLM output
- **Parallel research** — Skills 1-4 run concurrently via ThreadPoolExecutor (~4x faster)

### Changed
- Updated docs (CLI_REFERENCE, DOCKER.md, docker-compose.yml) for multi-provider support
- All agent code now uses provider abstraction instead of direct Bedrock calls

### Philosophy
- Framework-first approach: "Structure over software, adapt to your environment"

- Optional tooling: CLI enhances but doesn't replace core workflow
- Progression-minded: Start simple, scale when complexity demands it

## Contribution Notes

ATHF is a framework to internalize, not a platform to extend. However, if you've adapted ATHF in interesting ways or have feedback, we'd love to hear about it in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Nebulock-Inc/agentic-threat-hunting-framework/discussions).

For more on the philosophy, see [USING_ATHF.md](../USING_ATHF.md).
